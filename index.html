  <p class="simpsons__description description">The Simpson family consists of fictional characters featured in the
    animated
    television series The Simpsons. The Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and
    their three children Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of
    Springfield, United States, and they were created by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after
    his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The
    Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the
    U.S. on December 17, 1989.</p>

      Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[36] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the
      spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds),
      lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great
      caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as
      the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.

      His favorite color is blue and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade
      racer, playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride
      the Champion Mechanical Horse".

      Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is
      often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his
      friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the
      couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham
      Simpson II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually
      hates his wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be
      the minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is his legal adoptive
      father.[37]

      Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a
      Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.

      Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening. In a series of interviews in 1990, Groening
      reportedly stated that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day Of the Locust, a 1939 novel by
      Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson, but neither explanation is considered definitive.

      Marjorie Jacqueline "Marge" Simpson (n√©e Bouvier[11]) is the homemaker and
      matriarch of the Simpson family. She is also one of the five main characters in The Simpsons TV series. Marge is
      37 years of age. She and her husband Homer have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic
      force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain
      order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of careers
      ranging from a police officer to an anti-violence activist.

      Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson (born April 1[7] or February
      23[8]) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the
      Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and
      Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the
      cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also
      has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt
      Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

      Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[9], he has
      discovered a new comet which was named after him[10], and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse
      Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.

      Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two
      tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

      In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called
      Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard
      achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral
      center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to
      hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In
      school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a
      few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already
      a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who
      she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do whatever it
      takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent
      one who usually thinks things through.
